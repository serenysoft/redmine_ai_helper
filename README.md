## Custom Commands

Custom Commands allow you to create reusable prompt shortcuts for the AI Helper chat interface. Define a command once and invoke it by typing `/commandname` in the chat input. An autocomplete dropdown appears as you type, showing available commands with their descriptions.

Three scope levels are available: **Global** (available across all projects), **Project** (available within a specific project), and **User** (personal commands visible only to you). When multiple commands share the same name, User commands take the highest priority, followed by Project commands, then Global commands.

Commands support template variables `{input}`, `{user_name}`, `{project_name}`, and `{datetime}` for dynamic prompt generation. You can manage custom commands from the "Custom Commands" tab on the AI Helper dashboard.

## Project Health Report

You can generate a project health report using the AI Helper Plugin. This feature provides a comprehensive overview of the project's status, including metrics such as open issues, closed issues, and overall project health.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f01c6ef-6cee-4e79-b693-c17081566c78)

Health reports can be exported to Markdown and PDF formats.

### Health Report History

Health reports are automatically saved and can be reviewed later. You can:
- View past health reports to track project progress over time
- Compare multiple health reports to analyze trends and changes in project health
- Export comparison results to Markdown and PDF formats

This historical tracking helps you understand how your project's health evolves and identify patterns or issues early.

### Health Report REST API

You can generate health reports programmatically using the REST API. This allows you to schedule automatic health report generation using cron or other task schedulers.

**Endpoint:**
```
POST /projects/:project_id/ai_helper/health_report.json
```

**Authentication:**
Use Redmine's standard API key authentication by including the `X-Redmine-API-Key` header.

**Example Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  https://your-redmine-instance.com/projects/your-project/ai_helper/health_report.json
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "project_id": 1,
  "project_identifier": "your-project",
  "health_report": "# Project Health Report\n\n...",
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Requirements:**
- The user associated with the API key must have the `view_ai_helper` permission for the project
- The AI Helper module must be enabled for the project
- REST API must be enabled in Redmine administration settings

**Scheduling with cron:**
To generate health reports automatically every Monday at 9:00 AM, add the following to your crontab:
```bash
0 9 * * 1 curl -X POST -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: your_api_key_here" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://your-redmine-instance.com/projects/your-project/ai_helper/health_report.json
```

## Multi-modal File Support

The AI Helper Plugin can analyze files attached to Issues, Wiki pages, and Board messages. When enabled, attached files are sent to the LLM alongside the content, allowing the AI to understand and reference file contents when generating summaries or responding in chat.

**Supported file types:**

| Category | Extensions |
|----------|------------|
| Images | .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp, .bmp |
| Documents | .pdf, .txt, .md, .csv, .json, .xml |
| Code | .rb, .py, .js, .html, .css, and more |
| Audio | .mp3, .wav, .m4a, .ogg, .flac |

To enable this feature, go to the AI Helper settings page in the Administration menu. Check **"Send attachments to LLM"** and optionally set the maximum file size limit (default: 3 MB). Files exceeding the limit are not sent to the LLM.

You can also ask the AI to analyze specific attached files directly in the chat interface using the file analysis tools.

When vector search is enabled, attachment contents are also incorporated into the vector index. The LLM analyzes attachments during index registration and similar-issue searches, resulting in more accurate similarity matching for issues that carry meaningful file attachments.

# 📦 Installation

1. Extract the plugin to your Redmine plugins folder:
   ```bash
   cd {REDMINE_ROOT}/plugins/
   git clone https://github.com/haru/redmine_ai_helper.git
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. Run database migrations:

   ```

4. Restart Redmine:


# ⚙️ Basic Configuration

## Plugin Settings

1. Open the AI Helper settings page from the Administration menu.
2. Create a model profile and fill in the following fields:
   - Type: Choose the AI model type (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic. Strongly recommend using OpenAI or Anthropic)
   - Name: Enter a name for the model profile
   - Access Key: Enter the API key for the AI service
   - Model name: Specify the AI model name (e.g., gpt-4.1-mini)
   - Temperature: Set the temperature for the AI model (e.g., 0.7)
3. Select the model profile you created from the dropdown menu and save the settings.


## Think Model Settings

You can optionally configure a separate model profile for tasks that require deeper reasoning, such as project health report generation and issue reply drafting. When not configured, all tasks use the standard model profile.

## Role and Permission Settings

1. Go to "Roles and permissions" in the administration menu
2. Configure the AI Helper permissions for each role as needed

## Project-specific Settings

1. Open the settings page for each project where you want to use the plugin
2. Go to the "Modules" tab
3. Enable "AI Helper" by checking the box
4. Click "Save" to apply the changes

# ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

## Nginx Reverse Proxy Settings

If you are running Redmine behind an Nginx reverse proxy, you must disable response buffering to allow the plugin's SSE (Server-Sent Events) streaming to work correctly. Without these settings, the plugin may fail to authenticate users properly and behave as if requests are coming from an anonymous user.

Add the following five directives to your existing Nginx location block for Redmine:

```nginx
proxy_http_version 1.1;
proxy_set_header Connection "";
proxy_buffering off;
proxy_cache off;
proxy_set_header X-Accel-Buffering no;
```

`proxy_http_version 1.1` and `proxy_set_header Connection ""` are required to enable HTTP/1.1 persistent connections between Nginx and the upstream server. Without them, Nginx defaults to HTTP/1.0, which does not properly support SSE streaming.

For example:

```nginx
location / {
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;  # Change to your Redmine server address

  # Required for SSE streaming — add these to your existing configuration
  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Connection "";
  proxy_buffering off;
  proxy_cache off;
  proxy_set_header X-Accel-Buffering no;

  proxy_set_header Host $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  proxy_redirect off;
  proxy_read_timeout 300;
}
```

After applying these changes, reload Nginx:

```bash
nginx -s reload
```

## MCP Server Settings

The "Model Context Protocol (MCP)" is an open standard protocol proposed by Anthropic that allows AI models to interact with external systems such as files, databases, tools, and APIs.
Reference: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers

The AI Helper Plugin can use the MCP Server to perform tasks, such as sending issue summaries to Slack.

1. Create `config/ai_helper/config.json` under the root directory of Redmine.
2. Configure the MCP server as follows (example for Slack, GitHub, and Context7):
   ```json
   {
      "mcpServers": {
         "slack": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
               "-y",
               "@modelcontextprotocol/server-slack"
            ],
            "env": {
               "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN": "xoxb-your-bot-token",
               "SLACK_TEAM_ID": "T01234567"
            }
         },
         "github": {
            "type": "http",
            "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
            "headers": {
               "Authorization": "Bearer github_pat_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
            }
         },
         "context7": {
            "type": "sse",
            "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/sse"
         }
      }
   }
   ```
3. Restart Redmine.

## Vector Search Settings

Configure settings to perform vector searches for issues using Qdrant.
With this configuration, the AI Helper Plugin can use Qdrant to perform vector searches on Redmine issues and wiki data.

**Note:** Vector search functionality is not available when using Anthropic AI models. Please use OpenAI or other supported AI providers for vector search features.

### Qdrant Setup

Here is an example configuration using Docker Compose.

```yaml:docker-compose.yml
services:
   qdrant:
      image: qdrant/qdrant
      ports:
         - 6333:6333
      volumes:
         - ./storage:/qdrant/storage
```

### Creating the Index

Run the following command to create the index.

```bash
bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:ai_helper:vector:generate RAILS_ENV=production
```

Registers ticket data into the index. The initial run may take some time.

```bash
bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:ai_helper:vector:regist RAILS_ENV=production
```

Please execute the above commands periodically using cron or a similar tool to reflect ticket updates.

This completes the configuration.

### Recreating the Index

If you change the embedding model, delete the index and recreate it using the following commands.

```bash
bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:ai_helper:vector:destroy RAILS_ENV=production
```

# 🛠️ Build your own Agent

The AI Helper plugin adopts a multi-agent model. You can create your own agent and integrate it into the AI Helper plugin.

To create your own agent, you need to create the following two files:

- **Agent Implementation**
   - A class that inherits from `RedmineAiHelper::BaseAgent`
   - Override `available_tool_providers` to return an array of your `BaseTools` subclasses
   - Override `backstory` to return the agent's system prompt context
   - Defines the agent's behavior
- **Tools**
   - A class that inherits from `RedmineAiHelper::BaseTools`
   - Implements the tools used by the agent

Place these files in any location within Redmine and load them.

As an example, there is a plugin called `redmine_fortune` under the `example` directory. Place this plugin in the `plugins` folder of Redmine. This will add a fortune-telling feature to the AI Helper plugin. When you ask, "Tell me my fortune for today," it will return a fortune-telling result.

# 🪄 Langfuse integration
By integrating with Langfuse, you can track the usage of the AI Helper Plugin. This allows you to monitor the cost of LLM queries and improve prompts effectively.


![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35904911-db39-4da7-baf6-a90fe05d9115)

To configure the integration, add the following to `{REDMINE_ROOT}/config/ai_helper/config.yml`:

```yaml
langfuse:
  public_key: "pk-lf-************"
  secret_key: "sk-lf-************"
  endpoint: https://us.cloud.langfuse.com # Change this to match your environment
```

# ⚠️ Important Notice

Please note that AI responses may not always be 100% accurate. Users should verify and validate AI-provided information at their own discretion.
